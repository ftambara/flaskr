## Purpose

This app was created while following the 
[Flask tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/).
My intention was to learn how to use Flask, so that I could create simple web 
applications whenever necessary. I also took the opportunity to add tests 
right from the start, to get some practice with pytest.

## Warning

Please note that this app is not intended to be deployed to a production
environment. It is only meant to be run locally, for development and testing
purposes.
